# the periodical
We know a lot about periods and we think you should, too. See the site live <a href="http://tcburning.com/the-periodical">here</a>.

This is a web page built to de-mystify the monthly gifts bestowed upon roughly half the population. This hack was built at AngelHack's United Nations summer 2015 hackathon, and aims to provide clarity and perspective to ultimately remove the taboo of periods. Periods happen. All the time. It's fine.
